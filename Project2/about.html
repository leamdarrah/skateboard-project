            <br><h1>Meepo Mini 2</h1><br></br>
            <p>Meepo Mini is our best shortboard electric skateboard. It is got beast of an engine, enabling this hot little board to reach an astonishing 29 mph/ 46 kph. Of all our boards, it’s our best electric skateboard for those looking for speed and portability. The sleek, slick design makes for a smooth ride sure to turn heads and make them ask what was that?</p><br>
            <p>The Mini 2 has the same powerful motors as the V3 and NLS Pro. The ability and range also vary depending on the build of the Mini 2 that you choose. The ER can take grades up to 30%, while the regular motor just 25% (which is still plenty for many!) Another benefit of upgrading is speed - the upgraded motors reach 29 mph (46 kph) while the standard reach only 25 mph (40 kph). Many lifestyle riders find the standard equipment to be more than sufficient. Riders closer to the 300 lb (136 kg) weight limit or those in hilly areas are recommended to opt for the upgraded engines. While the regular Mini 2 has a range of 11 miles/ 17.7 km, the ER version lets you ride for 20 miles/ 32 km.</p><br>

            <br><h1>Meep NLS Pro</h1><br></br>
            <p>Our most comfortable electric skateboard yet, the NLS Pro has been upgraded for speed and performance. Take your electric skateboard game to the next level with Meepo NLS Pro. This is the board for riders who have high standards both in terms of comfort and power. This board can handle up to 28 mph / 46 kph rides for up to 2 hours. It’s our fastest skateboard yet.</p><br>
              <p>This fierce board comes with upgraded ESC and the Meepo ER battery standard, along with the latest remote, the NR with flashlight. Its upgrades make this the best performing Meepo Board yet. Or as electric skateboard blogger Samuel James says: “It's a serious rival for Boosted in terms of comfort and it easily out-specs other boards more than twice its price.” This is also the reason why leading Eskate Youtube Influencers such as Talon Sei and Fabi have given it excellent reviews (scroll down to watch the videos). </p><br>

            <br><h1>Meepo V3</h1><br></br>
              <p>The ESC latest version is Meepo ESC v 6.0 featuring complete sealing with glue, making the board water resistant, as well as moisture & dustproof. Enjoy a total new braking experience with smooth and predictable brakes - no more dead zone. Is this is the most powerful and fastest skateboard? It’s the most powerful of all regular skateboards.The AWD PRO ($849) is more powerful, due to its all-wheel drive. For most enthusiasts looking for power and speed, the Meepo V3 is more than enough. Even on hills, this board is relentless, reaching speeds of up to 20km/hr (9 mph) on a 15% slope. If you live in a very hilly area, the AWD might be better, but for most skaters the V3 is the most convenient and best electric skateboard all around.</p><br>
              <p>This board comes with a six month warranty. Each board is tested by our QA team and every part has undergone testing as well. The hub motors on the V3 feature upgraded PU, bearings, magnetic chip, and a new cap. You’ll love the macaroons brushings and soon front & rear lights will be available. Join 30,000 Meepo Board riders today.</p><br>
              <p>And there are even surprises, like the standard USB charger that allows you to use the charge on your Meepo V3 to charge your phone or portable speaker.</p><br>
